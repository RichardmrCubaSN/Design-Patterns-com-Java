# JAVA DESIGN PATTERNS 
- In 1994, four authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides published a book titled Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software which initiated the concept of Design Pattern in Software development.
- These authors are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF). According to these authors design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design.
     1) Program to an interface not an implementation
     2) Favor object composition over inheritance

# ðŸ”­ Types of Design Patterns

# Creational Patterns
- These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. 
- This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

# Structural Patterns
- These design patterns concern class and object composition. 
- Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

# Behavioral Patterns
- These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

# J2EE Patterns
- These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. 
- These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.

# ðŸ‘¯ some of the most used Design Patterns available in JAVA are:

- Singleton Design Pattern

- Facade Design Pattern

- Observer Design Pattern 

# Singleton Design Pattern

- Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
- This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

# Facade Design Pattern

- Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.
- This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes.
